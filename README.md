# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA

As part of my Business Intelligence course with United Network of Professionals (UNP), I worked on a Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard to analyze key logistics and inventory trends. The goal was to transform raw supply chain data into insights that help in optimizing inventory management, tracking supplier performance, and improving operational efficiency.  
 
Project Workflow:  
 
1. Data Collection & Understanding:  

   - Explored supply chain data covering inventory levels, supplier details, order fulfillment rates, shipping times, and costs.  
 
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:  

   - Ensured data consistency by fixing data types, removing duplicates, and handling missing values.  
 
3. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  

   - Identified essential metrics such as on-time delivery rate, inventory turnover ratio, order accuracy, and supplier lead time.  
 
4. Creating Measures using DAX:  

   - Developed DAX-based calculations for key metrics like stock levels, average delivery time, and cost per shipment.  
 
5. Building Visualizations:  

   - Designed charts, graphs, and tables to represent inventory movement, supplier performance, and cost efficiency trends.  
 
6. Adding Slicers &Â Interactivity:

   - Implemented filters and slicers to analyze supply chain data across different regions, time periods, and product categories.  
 
8. Developing a Dynamic Dashboard:  

   - Created a real-time dashboard providing insights into supply chain bottlenecks, inventory shortages, and cost optimization strategies.  
 
Outcome & Impact:  

The Supply Chain Dashboard helped businesses:  

- Monitor inventory turnover and optimize stock levels to prevent shortages.  

- Improve supplier performance tracking through real-time insights.  

- Reduce delivery delays and operational inefficiencies.  

- Enhance logistics planning and cost management.  
 
This project demonstrated how Power BI enables data-driven supply chain optimization, helping businesses reduce costs, improve efficiency, and ensure smooth operations.
